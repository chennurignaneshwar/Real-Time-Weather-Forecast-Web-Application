# Weather-report-app

This project involved the creation of a fully functional, client-side Weather App. The aim was to apply core front-end development skills in a real-world scenario by designing an interactive and responsive weather forecasting tool. The application allows users to enter any city and receive instant weather updates powered by the OpenWeatherMap API.

Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the app features:

Real-time weather data (temperature, humidity, wind, condition)

A loading spinner to indicate fetch activity

Dynamic background changes based on weather conditions (e.g., sunny, rainy)

5-day weather forecast view

Search history retained using browser localStorage

The app focuses on a user-friendly interface, responsiveness, and seamless integration of external data sources. It emphasizes DOM manipulation, event handling, API integration, and state persistence—critical areas in modern front-end development.

This project helped reinforce the intern’s technical foundation and provided valuable experience in designing and building a standalone application from scratch. It also demonstrated practical problem-solving abilities and the capacity to convert a user need into a fully realized digital solution.
